- 16-bit Space Adventure Music Pack by Chris Kohler -

Thank you for downloading this music pack!

How to use this pack?
All audio tracks are already cut to loop seamlessly. Every track has two files (a and b). Track a is to be played first. Track b is to be played second and can be looped indefinetely, because it contains the reverb tail from the end of track a. 

Why do we need the reverb tail?
This reverb tail is essential for a realistic and seamless transition at the end of the loop. If only track b was to be played, right in the beginning you would hear reverb from music that has not been played before. For some tracks this might go unnoticed, but for others, especially the louder ones, this is clearly audible. Without the reverb tail however there would be a unnatural absence of sound everytime the loop starts over. This is why there are two audio files for every track. To give you the best quality loops possible.

If you have any questions or problems with the music pack feel free to contact me. I am also available to compose custom music for your game.

Good luck with your game project!
